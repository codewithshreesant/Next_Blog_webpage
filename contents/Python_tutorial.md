## Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Python, visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

### Hello World

```python
print("Hello, World!")


### Basic Syntax

Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Here are some basic rules:Indentation is used to define blocks of code.Comments start with #.

Example

# This is a comment
if True:
    print("Hello, World!")


##  Data Types

Python supports various data types, including:Numbers: int, float, complexStrings: strLists: listTuples: tupleDictionaries: dictSets: set

Example

# Numbers
x = 10
y = 3.14
z = 1 + 2j

# Strings
s = "Hello, World!"

# Lists
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples
tup = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionaries
d = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

# Sets
st = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


## Variables

Variables in Python are dynamically typed. You can assign values without declaring their type.

Example

x = 10
y = "Hello"
z = 3.14


## Operators

Python supports various operators, including:

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=Logical Operators: and, or, not

Example

# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10 + 5
b = 10 - 5
c = 10 * 5
d = 10 / 5
e = 10 % 3

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a > b)
print(a < b)
print(a >= b)
print(a <= b)

# Logical Operators
print(a > 5 and b < 5)
print(a > 5 or b < 5)
print(not(a > 5))


## Control Flow

Control flow statements include:if statementsfor loopswhile loops

Example

# if statement
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

# for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# while loop
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


## Functions

Functions are defined using the def keyword.

Example

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))


## Modules


Modules are files containing Python code. You can import them using the import statement.

Example


import math
print(math.sqrt(16))


## Exception Handling

Exceptions are handled using try and except blocks.

Example

try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")


## Object-Oriented Programming

Python supports OOP concepts like classes and objects.

Example

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.bark())


## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are used for pattern matching.

Example

import re
pattern = re.compile(r'\d+')
result = pattern.findall("There are 123 apples")
print(result)


## Libraries and Frameworks

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, including:Web Development: Django , Flask Data Science: NumPy , pandas , Matplotlib Machine Learning: scikit-learn , TensorFlow , PyTorch 

Example

# Using NumPy for numerical operations
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr.mean())

# Using pandas for data manipulation
import pandas as pd
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

# Using Matplotlib for plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 4, 9, 16, 25])
plt.show()


## Advanced Topics

Advanced topics include:DecoratorsGeneratorsContext ManagersConcurrency and Parallelism

## Decorators

Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of a function or class.

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()


## Generators

Generators are a way to create iterators in a simple way using the yield statement.

def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for value in my_generator():
    print(value)

## Context Managers

Context managers are used to manage resources, like file streams

with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")


## Concurrency and Parallelism

Python supports concurrency and parallelism using threads and multiprocessing.



import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()
